        This is a place for me to record artists and techniques that I enjoy for
        future reference.

      <h2>Arthur Rackham and Alice Cao</h2>
      <p>
        Arthur Rackham is one of the most famous illustrators of traditional
        fairytales. He draws his forms in a very classical style. The piece is
        done in layers of watercolor glaze, giving a soft, blended look to all
        of the paintings. The linework is done with black ink and minimally in
        hair, clothing folds, outlines, and single-hatch shadows. Alice Cao is a
        more modern illustrator who uses similar technique. Her colors are much
        brighter and have more depth than those of Rackham. She also uses more
        ink, filling the page with abundant directional hatching.

      <h2>Vincent Van Gogh</h2>
      <p>
        Vincent Van Gogh was a post-impressionist artist who worked with
        charcoal, ink, and (most famously) oil paints to create incredible works
        of art. His strokes are filled with movement, using them to emphasize
        movement and emotion within a scene. Colors are often very vivid.
        Linework becomes progressively more similar to that of Japanese
        woodblock prints. He is known for his notable use of yellows within his
        work.

      <h2>Tom Moore</h2>
      <p>
        Tom Moore is a filmmaker and artist known primarily for his trilogy
        based on Irish folklore, comprising "The Secret of Kells", "The Song of
        the Sea", and "Wolfwalkers". Scenes are made by layering different
        watercolors and outlining with similar colors. Initial sketchmarks are
        left in the final product in a lighter tone, showing through in some
        areas. Most aspects of the world have subtle patterning to them
        comprised of spiraling designs reminiscent of traditional Irish stone
        art symbols. Most of the colors, designs, and symbolism is derived from
        the manuscript "The Book of Kells". Characters and familiar areas are
        often round wheras industrial areas or characters with negative
        connotations are sharp.
